# Terraform Learning Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to my Terraform learning journey! In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress as I learn and explore Terraform, an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp. The purpose of this README is to provide an overview of my learning goals, resources, notes, and any projects I undertake using Terraform.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Terraform, you can start by installing Terraform on your local machine. Follow the official installation guide: [Terraform Installation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

Once Terraform is installed, you can set up your development environment and create your first Terraform configuration files. You may also want to explore cloud service providers' documentation (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to understand the available resources you can manage with Terraform.

## Learning Resources

I'll be using various online resources to learn Terraform. Here are some of the key learning materials I'll be referring to:

1. [HashiCorp Learn Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform)
2. [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)
3. Online tutorials and blog posts

## Terraform Projects

As part of my learning journey, I plan to work on various Terraform projects to practice my skills and gain hands-on experience. I'll be documenting each project in separate directories within this repository.

1. [Project 1 - Provisioning AWS EC2 Instances](/projects/project1)
2. [Project 2 - Creating a Kubernetes Cluster with EKS](/projects/project2)

## My Learnings

In this section, I'll be documenting my key learnings, insights, and challenges encountered while learning Terraform. I'll update this section as I progress through my learning journey.

### Week 1

- Learned about Terraform basics, including providers, resources, and data sources.
- Practiced creating simple AWS resources using Terraform.

### Week 2

- Explored Terraform modules and how to reuse configurations.
- Implemented a reusable module for provisioning VPCs.
